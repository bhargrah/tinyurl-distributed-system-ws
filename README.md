# URL-shortening Service
Implementation of TinyURL system using Java and other distributed paradigm


## What we will learn 
-  Look at the concepts of distrIbuted systems
-  Understand synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
-  Study service meshes and Idempotent service design
-  Differentiate between traditional RDBMS systems and NoSQL
-  Learn deployment requirements for strongly consistent distributed systems
-  Build distributed URL-shortening services like Tiny-URL Audience

This project is designed for Java developers and architects who wish to broaden their knowledge of distributed computing, NoSQL databases, efficient RPC calls, messaging middleware, and cluster coordination. It is also recommended for anyone working in modern IT landscapes. The course may be a good recap for people preparing for systems design interviews.
